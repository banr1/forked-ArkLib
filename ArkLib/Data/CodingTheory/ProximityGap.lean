/-- The proximity measure of two vectors `u` and `v` from a code `C` at distance `d` is the number
  of vectors at distance at most `d` from the linear combination of `u` and `v` with coefficients
  `r` in `F`. -/
def proximityMeasure (u v : n → F) (d : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  Fintype.card {r : F | Δ₀'(r • u + (1 - r) • v, C) ≤ d}

/-- A code `C` exhibits proximity gap at distance `d` and cardinality bound `bound` if for every
      pair of vectors `u` and `v`, whenever the proximity measure for `C u v d` is greater than
      `bound`, then the distance of `[u | v]` from the interleaved code `C ^⊗ 2` is at most `d`. -/
def proximityGap (d : ℕ) (bound : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ u v : n → F, (proximityMeasure C u v d > bound)
    → (Δ₀( u ⋈ v , C ^⋈ Fin 2 ) ≤ d)

/-- A code `C` exhibits `δ`-correlated agreement with respect to a tuple of vectors `W_1, ..., W_k`
  if there exists a set `S` of coordinates such that the size of `S` is at least `(1 - δ) * |n|`,
  and there exists a tuple of codewords `v_1, ..., v_k` such that `v_i` agrees with `W_i` on `S`
  for all `i`. -/

    ∃ v : Fin k → n → F, ∀ i, v i ∈ C ∧ {j | v i j = W i j} = S
